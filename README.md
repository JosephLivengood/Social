#### Also includes:
* Chai/Mocha - Chai is a BDD / TDD assertion library for node and the browser that can be delightfully paired with any javascript testing framework.
* Webpack/Babel - Webpack takes modules with dependencies and generates static assets representing those modules.
* Sass - Sass is the most mature, stable, and powerful professional grade CSS extension language in the world.
* ReactTooltip - ReactTooltip is the most versitile easy tooltip component for React. Read more about it [here](https://github.com/wwayne/react-tooltip).
* Bootstrap v4 - Bootstrap is the most popular HTML, CSS, and JS framework in the world for building responsive, mobile-first projects on the web. It also speeds up development greatly.
* Font Awesome - Font Awesome gives you scalable vector icons that can instantly be customized â€” size, color, drop shadow, and anything that can be done with the power of CSS.
* Bootstrap-Social - Easy way to bring social icons and login styled buttons in an extremely lightweight stylesheet.

## Structure

The aim of this project is to have an extremely scaleable solution for your next project with modularity at every point on the back and front. It should be extremely simple to add or remove features including authentication strategies; it should not require editing of the low level _how_ to make it work! Files are small, understandable, and you won't find duplicate code.

#### Basic Structure:
```
Boilerplate/
  /app
    /auth
    /controllers
    /routes
  /client
    /app
      /commonComponents
      /scenes
  /public
    /views
    /style
    /resources
    /js
  /test
  server.js
```
#### Reducers
You will often find _'reducers'_ within packages similar to below:
```javascript
app/routes/index.js

const apiRoutes = require('./api/apiIndex.js');
const publicRoutes = require('./public/publicIndex.js');
const errorMiddleware = require('./errorMiddleware.js');

module.exports = (app, db) => {
    apiRoutes(app, db);
    publicRoutes(app, db);
    errorMiddleware(app, db);
};
```
__Remember, files should have 1 specific focus and be organized!__
Create your code with a clear heirarchy and package it for the future, not the present! You may even find within `apiRoutes`, for example, you have multiple types of api requests for unrelated types of data. In this case, implement a _'reducer'_ similar to above and further comparmentalize your code!

## Installation and Starting
#### For contributing(see [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md)):
```
(Fork/pull)

npm install
cp sample.env .env

(Branch, LEAVE MASTER CLEAN)
```
#### For personal projects:
```
git clone https://github.com/JosephLivengood/Boilerplate.git (Or the version desired)
rm -r .git
git init
npm install
cp sample.env .env
```
### First run

##### Set enviromental variables in `.env`
* Database should look similar to `mongodb://[username]:[password]@12345.mlab.com:17109/boilerplate`
* Ignore TEST_USER_ID for this step
* Obtain auth client id and secrets from atleast 1 service (GitHub recomended in acount settings)- for local development(w/ GitHub), the callback url is `http://localhost:8080/auth/github/callback` if running locally

##### Excute `NPM run build-react` and `NPM run build-css`
* This webpacks the React files into _public/js_ and compiles the Sass into css from _client/style_ to _public/style_

##### Execute `NPM start`
```
Successful database connection
App listening on port 8080
```

##### Authenticate at http://localhost:8080/auth/github or by clicking the login button
* Take note of the returned user `id` (not `_id`)

##### Set final enviromental variable in `.env`
* TEST_USER_ID should be set equal to your `id`- this is used in unit/functional tests to simulate an authenticated user when testing pages requiring such

### Running
* `NPM start` will connect to the database and start the server.

## Tests
* To execute all tests, run `NPM Tests`

## Development (for personal projects)

### See [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md)) for more in depth info on all dependancies in the repo:

##### Webpack

Webpack compiles your .jsx es6 React.js files into .js browser-friendly cross-compatable files. Compilation/building occurs from _client/app_ to _public/js_. This project sets you up to use multiple entry points. Each 'scene' in _client/app/scenes_ should be a new entry point defined in _webpack.config.js_. Its name in the config will determine the name of the compiled file that will be used as an include in your html/jade file. See [DEVELOPING.md](DEVELOPING.md)).

##### Notes
* After editing a .sass file in _client/style_, be sure to run `npm run build-css`. Alternatively, run `npm run watch-css` if you want it to auto compile on save.
* After editing a .jsx file in _client/app_, be sure to run `npm run build-react`. Alternatively, run `npm run watch-react` if you want it to auto build on save.

## Deployment (for personal projects)
* Be sure to edit your authentication strategies on their respective websites to point the callback to your deployment url.
* Be sure to change `config.json` `"app_url"` to your correct deployment root url.
* Ensure tests pass before deploying and be sure to webpack any changes for production using `npm run build-react-prod`.
